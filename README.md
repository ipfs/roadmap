# IPFS Project Roadmap 

As a community-driven project, IPFS does not have a single roadmap. As of 2023, there are multiple companies and teams building IPFS implementations. 

To encourage both innovation and interoperability, the IPFS community focuses on [**specs and standards**](https://specs.ipfs.tech/) and uses the [IPIP process](https://specs.ipfs.tech/meta/ipip-process/) as a Lightweight Improvement Process for IPFS Specifications.

To learn more about the directions IPFS see:
