## 🚀 Major 2019 goals to achieve

The major goals below and following milestones have been labeled with the emoji for the goal in the IPFS Project Roadmap that they contribute towards: 📦 = Package Managers 🤝 = Partner Use Cases  

_(Note: we also have many 🧠 = Strategic Projects)_

- **1)** The IPFS org has clearly communicated vision, goals, and priorities to align and accelerate project development and adoption. 📦 🤝 🧠
- **2)** A baseline suite of Coordination Strategies and Tools becomes first nature to the org. These have minimal overhead without losing clarity and productivity. 📦 🤝 🧠
- **3)** The IPFS org increases its ability to operate at scale (ability to support a growth of 1 order of magnitude in the number of contributors, from X,000 to X0,000). 📦 🤝 🧠
